### **Analysis Plan**

**Accident Analysis:**
- Investigate accident types, conditions, and severity.
- Identify common accident types and conditions leading to severe accidents.

**Severity Analysis:**
- Analyze how factors such as speed zones, light conditions, and accident types relate to severity.
- Determine key factors contributing to severe accidents.

**Environmental Analysis:**
- Assess the impact of environmental conditions (e.g., light conditions, road geometry) on accident frequency and severity.
- Identify hazardous conditions for drivers.

### **Approach**

1. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Inspect data for NULL and missing values.
   - Apply data replacement methods as needed.

2. **Database Setup:**
   - Create a database and tables.
   - Insert data, ensuring no NULL values by setting fields as NOT NULL.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Add columns to categorize accidents by time of day, day name, month name, and detailed descriptions of light conditions, severity, speed zones, and accident types.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct EDA to address project goals and answer key questions.
   - Use visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
